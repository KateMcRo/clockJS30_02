# JavaScript Clock

## Description

This is the second exercise in the Wes Bos JavaScript 30 challenge. The challenge was to get the clock hands to reflect the actual time and rotate continuously.

- My motivation was to continue to build my skillset
- This exercise was interesting because it utilized mathematical formulas to update the styling each second
- The biggest challenge I faced was removing and reapplying styling at the last degree to give the appearance of a smooth transition.

## Usage

Once the page loads, it will continously update the clock hands to reflect the current time down to the second. I adjusted the thickness of the hands to make it easier to identify which unit they represented with the thickest for hours, and the thinnest for seconds.
